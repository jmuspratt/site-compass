This is my starting-point for most sites.

While it doesn't don't assume any particular CMS or CSS framework, I do assume I'm going to use the following:

* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) & [Compass](http://compass-style.org)
* [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com)
* [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)

The most important stuff is in the [utilities](https://github.com/jmuspratt/site-template/blob/master/sass/_utilities.scss) partial, which contains all SASS my mixins.
